# Quick Start

!> NOTE: You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and some code editing software (recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) installed on your computer to follow this guide

To get started building a plugin, open your terminal, go to a directory you want using `cd /directory/path/here` and run `git clone https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/SolarStatsPluginTemplate.git`.

Now, run `cd SolarStatsPluginTemplate` and run `npm install`.

Next, open your code editor and go to the `SolarStatsPluginTemplate` folder that was made.

You should now be ready to start making your plugin.

#### All commands you should have run: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

```bash
cd /directory/path/here
git clone https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/SolarStatsPluginTemplate.gi
cd SolarStatsPluginTemplate
npm install

(If you have VS Code and VS Code CLI) code ./
```
