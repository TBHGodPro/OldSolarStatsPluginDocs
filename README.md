# What is all this about?

[SolarStats](https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/SolarStats) is a proxy server for hypixel, you can use it to improve gameplay with plugins that add features to your game experience.

You can view some plugins I've made [here](https://github.com/TBHGodPro/SolarStatsPlugins).

Plugins are coded in JavaScript (Just like the rest of SolarStats).

Plugins have special properties to them, such as a different top-level scope, and have special ways to do stuff. These docs will cover all of that and help you get your first plugin ready to be published!
